## Code Explanation

1. **Model Loading**: 
   - The script loads multiple YOLO models trained for different purposes, such as detecting people, trains, yellow lines, etc. These models are essential for object detection within the video frames.

2. **Function Definitions**: 
   - `load_class_names`: This function loads class names from a provided file path. These class names are used to interpret the model's output.
   - `in_vision`: Determines whether a given point is within the defined area of interest.
   - `euclidian`: Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points of the yellow line.
   - `is_crossing_line`: Checks if a person crosses a specified line segment.

3. **Initialization**: 
   - The script initializes necessary variables, such as video paths, font for text rendering, and model instances.

4. **Model Inference**:
   - The script performs inference on the loaded video frames using YOLO models. It detects various objects like people, trains, yellow lines, and platform edges.

5. **Object Tracking and Analysis**: 
   - Based on the detected objects, the script tracks human activities, particularly focusing on interactions with the platform edge and train tracks. It identifies instances where individuals lean over, cross the yellow line, or approach the edge of the platform.

6. **Visual Feedback**:
   - The script overlays bounding boxes and textual annotations on the video frames to visually indicate detected objects and potential safety concerns.

7. **User Interaction**: 
   - The processed video feed is displayed in a window, allowing real-time observation. The user can quit the application by pressing the 'q' key.

This script provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring platform safety and detecting potentially hazardous behaviors in real-time video feeds.
